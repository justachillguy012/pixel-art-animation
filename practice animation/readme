# 🧪 Practice Pixel Animations

This folder contains **practice animations** redrawn for educational purposes.  
They are based on or inspired by original game sprites found on public sprite databases like [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- These are **not original creations**.
- I do **not own** the characters, art, or animations.
- These assets are **redrawn by hand at lower resolution** to study motion, form, and animation flow.
- **Not for commercial use**.
- All rights go to the respective original creators and studios (e.g., SNK, Capcom, etc.).

## ✅ Purpose

These practice pieces are:
- For improving my animation skills
- For learning traditional pixel art timing and motion
- For building discipline before I develop fully original work

> My original creations can be found in the `original-animations/` folder.
